# Micron Data Challenge

Welcome to my submission for the **Micron Data Challenge**. This repository showcases my approach to addressing the challenge using machine learning techniques.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

The goal of this project was to develop a model that effectively addresses the problem statement provided by Micron. The solution involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## ðŸ“Š Results

The final trained model achieved the following performance:

- **RÂ² Score:** 0.703  
- **RMSE:** 0.088  

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- `Micron_felicia_data_filtering.ipynb`: Some of my data preprocessing and filtering.
- `Micron_felicia_v5.ipynb`: Final model development and evaluation notebook (will tidy it up).
- `best_model.pt`: Saved PyTorch model weights for the trained model.
- `submission.csv`: Submitted csv file.
